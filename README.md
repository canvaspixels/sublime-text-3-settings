All my sublime text 3 settings

To install my settings (in mac) go to the Sublime Text Packages folder in terminal and move your User folder out the way.

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/
    mv User UserOld

Then clone this repo:

    git clone https://github.com/canvaspixels/sublime-text-3-settings.git User

Note that you may need to copy some of the existing files from UserOld to User:

    Package Control.last-run
    Package Control.ca-list
    Package Control.ca-bundle
    Package Control.system-ca-bundle
    Package Control.cache/
    Package Control.ca-certs/
    Package Control.merged-ca-bundle
    Package Control.sublime-settings
    Package Control.user-ca-bundle

Assuming you are on mac you could use finder:

    open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/
